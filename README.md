This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty` function. The `IsEmpty` function, while designed to check for empty or uninitialized variants, doesn't reliably detect empty strings ("").  This can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect results in functions that rely on `IsEmpty` for argument validation. The solution shows a more robust way to handle empty strings and nulls.
